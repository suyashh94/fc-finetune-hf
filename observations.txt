-- Current Implementation: 
- Functions have been defined in the config.py 
- Functions can have required and optional parameters
- Parameters can be of different types too (array, string, boolean, integer, number etc.)
- Dummy function calls were generated and can be found in ./data/function_calls.json 
- GPT was used to come up with "correct" user commands that will generate those function calls, containing 
information that is required to the function call only 
- Model was finetuned on this data for function calling 

-- Current Observation: 
- If the command is provided to do a specific thing, and if that thing can be done by the range of 
functions on which model was trained on, correct function is output (~100% accuracy)

- If the command has extra information or has things that are either not useful or make no sense, 
model "hallucinates" parameters.

- If the command has the right amount of information, then all of them are interpreted accurately (⬆️ 95%)

- The command is incomplete, it hallucinates parameter value
