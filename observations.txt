-- Current Implementation: 
- Functions have been defined in the config.py 
- Functions can have required and optional parameters
- Parameters can be of different types too (array, string, boolean, integer, number etc.)
- Dummy function calls were generated and can be found in ./data/function_calls.json 
- GPT was used to come up with "correct" user commands that will generate those function calls, containing 
information that is required to the function call only 
- Model was finetuned on this data for function calling 

-- Current Observation: 
- If the command is provided to do a specific thing, and if that thing can be done by the range of 
functions on which model was trained on, correct function is output (~100% accuracy)

- If the command has extra information or has things that are either not useful or make no sense, 
model "hallucinates" parameters.

- If the command has the right amount of information, then all of them are interpreted accurately (⬆️ 95%)

- The command is incomplete, it hallucinates parameter value

December 6 2024 
-- Training with only complete set - data that has been generated by "correct function calls (requireds are present, optional may or may not be present)"

set_temperature : 
 - Is able to id temperature correctly 
 - "In the back", "In the rear" are correctly mapped to [rear-right,rear left]
 -  "back left", "passenger in the front", "passenger in the back right" is correctly understood 
 - *"In the front"* is not understood by the model and maps it to all 4 regions 
 - * Units* are not correctly picked by the model right now 

adjust_temperature: 
 - "Raise the temperature","Lower the temperature" etc are being correctly mapped to increase/decrease etc 
 - "In the back", "back right", "for person in the front" etc are being correctly mapped 
 - * "In the front" is not understood and is mapped to all 4 regions 

set_fan_speed: 
 - "speed" argument is being correctly ided as per the intention 
 - "In the back","for passengers in the back", "passenger in the back right" are correctly understood by the model
 - *"In the front"*, for "passengers in the front" are not understood by the model

adjust_fan_speed:
 - speed : Increase or Decrease is correctly ided 
 - "In the back","for passengers in the back", "passenger in the back right" are correctly understood by the model
 - *"In the front"*, for "passengers in the front" are not understood by the model

adjust_seat
 - position - up/down, forward/backward is working correctly 
 - position - incline/decline has issues unless specified explicitly 
 - seat_type parameter is working correctly

control_window
 - window position is correctly identified 
 - *window location* is being misjudged mostly for "rear-left" with commands like "open windows for the passenger in the back left"

adjust_wiper_speed
 - seems to be working just fine 

set_wiper_speed: 
 - seems to working fine

activate_defroster:
 - seems to working fine 

start_engine: 
 - seems to be working fine 

lock_doors:
 - seems to be working mostly fine 
 - does not perform expected for command like "close the door" but mostly good 

play_music: 
 - mostly good 
 - need to augment data for "music titles" for better training i.e. right if title name 
 is more the 3 words, track recorded is upto 3 words
 - volume parameter is correctly ided 

toggle_headlights: 
 - seems to be working fine 

set_navigation_destination:
 - seems to be working fine 

control_ambient_lighting:
 - seems to be working fine 

set_cruise_control: 
 - seems to be working fine

toggle_sport_mode:
 - seems to be working fine

 - not that good, 6 training samples in total, lel!

 - volume parameter is correctly ided 

toggle_headlights: 
 - seems to be working fine 

set_navigation_destination:
 - seems to be working fine, need to replace |string| with actual place names, argument has been overfitted

 - seems to be working fine
